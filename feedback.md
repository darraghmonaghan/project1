##Creativity

* Great little app that integrates one of your interest with a definite use case.
* Given more time a few more visual designs would be helpful.

##Planning

* Way to scope down the project to something doable in the short amount of time. I'd love to see links to your user stories in your Readme.

##Execution

* Nice job creating a deployed CRUD app with authentication!
* See detailed feedback in each file in comments marked with my initials, `it: ...`.

##Next Steps

* Add a `.md` to your readme (which looks great). You can look up more on how to format markdown if you'd like to add to the readme's styling.
* Consider using a date picker input for date fields
* Consider adding model validations to the user for a signup (ex password must be > 6 characters, username is unique, etc)
* Consider adding client-side form validations to signup fields
